# Banking Microservices System - Spring Boot Application

## ‚úÖ Project Completion Status
This project **fully meets** the **Sr. Integration Developer Task** requirements. Below is a detailed breakdown of how each requirement has been implemented.

---

## üè¶ **Project Overview**
The **Banking Microservices System** is a scalable and distributed application for managing **customers and their bank accounts**. The system is designed using **Spring Boot (Java 21)** and follows best practices in **Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, TDD, and Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**.

The system consists of:
- **Account Service**: Manages bank accounts.
- **Customer Service**: Handles customer data.
- **Event Service**: Processes banking events using **Apache Kafka**.
